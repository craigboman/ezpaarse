Welcome to ezPAARSE's documentation!
====================================

`ezPAARSE <https://github.com/ezpaarse-project/ezpaarse>`_ is able to mine, analyse and enrich the locally collected logs generated by reverse proxies (ezProxy, Biblio PAM, Squid, Apache) which record access to academic and scientific publishers' platforms.
What you'll find here is the technical documentation for the ezPAARSE software.
For a more detailed documentation on the whole project, please consult `the AnalogIST platform <http://analogist.couperin.org>`_.
