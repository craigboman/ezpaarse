# Documentation

The documentation you are reading just now is powered by [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org).

You can run a live server with the following command :

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

To generate static assets, run :

```bash
npm run docs:build
```

The documentation is generated in `doc/.vuepress/dist/` and can be deployed to any static file server.
